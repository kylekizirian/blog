    "[Edit distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance) is both\n",
    "a wonderfully interesting algorithm and one with tremendous practical\n",
    "applications. Edit distance provides a measure of similarity between\n",
    "two strings (or any collection of items) from the number of additions,\n",
    "deletions, or substitutions required to change one string into the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the edit distance between \"band\" and \"bond\" is 1, requiring\n",
    "a change to just a single letter. The edit distance between \"foo\" and \"bar\"\n",
    "is 3, requiring the substitution of 3 letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edit distance is classically solved using\n",
    "[dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming),\n",
    "a technique where the the problem is broken down into sub-problems\n",
    "and the solutions to the sub-problems are combined to solve the problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about the edit distance between two strings, \"band\" and \"bond\".\n",
    "Let's say that we knew the edit distance between these three prefixes:\n",
    "- \"ban\" and \"bond\"\n",
    "- \"band\" and \"bon\"\n",
    "- \"ban\" and \"bon\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If we know the edit distance to each of these prefixes, then do we know\n",
    "the edit distance between our target string? It turns out that we do,\n",
    "if we take the prefix of just one string, i.e. \"ban\" and \"bond\", then\n",
    "we can add 1 to get the edit distance between our target strings,\n",
    "because we must add a \"d\" to the end of \"ban\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we know the edit distance between the prefix of both strings,\n",
    "\"ban\" and \"bon\", then the edit distance of our full string depends on\n",
    "whether the last letter is the same. If the last letter is the same,\n",
    "then the edit distance of the full string is the same as the edit\n",
    "distance of the prefix. If the last letter is not the same, then we\n",
    "must add 1 to the edit distance of the prefix string, because we'll\n",
    "make a substitution for the different characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting this all together, the edit distance of our full string\n",
    "is the minimum edit distance that we can get to given our prefix\n",
    "strings. Given two strings `a` and `b`, we can compute their\n",
    "edit distance as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "edit := 0\n",
    "if a[len(a)-1] != b[len(b)-1] {\n",
    "    edit = 1\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "min(\n",
    "    editDist(a[:len(a)-1, b[:len(b)-1]) + edit,\n",
    "    editDist(a[:len(a)-1, b[:len(b)]) + 1,\n",
    "    editDist(a[:len(a), b[:len(b)-1]) + 1,\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We've come up with a nice recursive formulation for edit distance,\n",
    "but what's the base case? The edit distance between anything and\n",
    "an empty string is the length of the non-empty string. So once we've\n",
    "hit an empty prefix string, we simply return the length of the\n",
    "non-empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we have a nice clean formulation for edit distance. Because\n",
    "we could compute the edit distance between any two collections\n",
    "of types, as long as we can check equality, we'll use\n",
