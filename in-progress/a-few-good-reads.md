# A few good reads

A few of my absolute favorite reads on the practice of programming. I
find myself coming back to these repeatedly and getting something new
out of them every time

- Allison Kapture on [Effective Learning Strategies for Programmers](http://akaptur.com/blog/2015/10/10/effective-learning-strategies-for-programmers/)
- Steve Yegge on [Practicing Programming](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/practicing-programming)
- David MacIver on [Some things that might help you write better software](https://www.drmaciver.com/2016/10/some-things-that-might-help-you-write-better-software/)
- Jeff Atwood [On the Meaning of Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/on-the-meaning-of-coding-horror/) and [Why I'm the Best Programmer in the World](https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-im-the-best-programmer-in-the-world/)
- Peter Norvig on [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](https://norvig.com/21-days.html)

And two bonus favorites, not strictly about programming but remarkable reads

- Paul Graham on
[What You'll Wish You'd Known](http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html) and
[Being a Noob](http://paulgraham.com/noob.html)
