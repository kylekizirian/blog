# Theme

This theme is adapted with minor modifications from Jake VanderPlas's
[Pythonic Perambulations blog](http://jakevdp.github.io/). See the
source for his theme [on
github](https://github.com/jakevdp/jakevdp.github.io-source/tree/master/theme).

Jake's theme is an adaptation of Daniel Rodriguez's theme for
[extrapolations.dev](https://extrapolations.dev/) which is the best
theme that I've found for rendering jupyter notebooks. See the source
[on github](https://github.com/danielfrg/extrapolations.dev) which
is released under the Apache v2.0 license.
